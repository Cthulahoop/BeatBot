BeatBot
=======

BeatBot is an Arduino based project created by Ric Ewing for the MakerHaus Arduino for Kids class. This was a combined hardware and software class aimed at kids age 12+ to build a handheld lo-fi synthesizer/sequencer and virtual pet.

In addition to the BeatBot sketch there is also the 'bot_test' sketch which can be used as a diagnostic tool for the physical project build.

Hardware Components
----------
I sourced the components for this project primarily from Adafruit, Jameco and Alphatronix. The following components were used:

- (1) Arduino Uno
- (2) Panel Mount 10K potentiometers
- (2) 1/4" shaft knobs with markers (Jameco #202287)
- (1) 9v battery holder (Jameco #216427)
- (4) 12mm tactile switch buttons
- (4) 6mm tactile switch buttons
- (1) Adafruit mini 8x8 LED matrix w/ I2C backpack
- (1) Adafruit RGB NeoPixel Stick (8 x WS2812 5050 RGB LEDs)
- (1) Slider power switch
- (1) 10 pin female header
- (1) Set of 40 female/male 3" extension jumper wires (Adafruit)
- (1) 3.5mm stereo headphone jack
- (1) Laser cut project box (three pannels of 3mm birch or acrylic)
- (4) #6 1.5" machine screws 
- (12) #6 nuts
- (2) #2 machine screws w/ nuts
- (3) 3mm 4" zip ties
- #26 solid core hookup wire
- .1" crimp male header pins

Optional:
- (2) #4 0.5" machine screws w/ nuts (replaces zip ties for Arduino)
- (2) #4 0.25" machine screws w/ nuts (replaces zip ties for battery holder)
