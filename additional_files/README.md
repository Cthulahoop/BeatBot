Libraries directory
-------------------

This directory holds slightly modified Adafruit libraries that I used when building the BeatBot. They are included here as reference. For more current versions, see Adafruit's GitHub, but note that it may cause some changes in the NeoPixel and 8x8 matrix behavior.

This is the Adobe Illustrator file I used to laser cut the body of the BeatBot.

This is an Excel spreadsheet that has graphs of the various wave tables and envelopes used in the synth.
